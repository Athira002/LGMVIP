# Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Terrorism Dataset

## Objective:

To analyze global terrorism incidents from 1970 to 2017, uncovering patterns related to attack types, affected regions, target categories, and terrorist groups.

## Key Insights:

• Most Affected Country: Iraq experienced the highest number of terrorist
attacks, followed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India.

• Peak Year: 2014 recorded the most attacks, indicating a significant surge in
global terrorism activities during that period.

• Common Attack Types: Bombings and explosions were the predominant
methods used in terrorist activities.

• Primary Targets: Private citizens and property were the most frequently
targeted, with military and police forces also heavily affected.

• Active Terrorist Groups: The Taliban and ISIL were among the most active
groups, responsible for a substantial number of attacks.

## Technical Approach:

• Data Handling: Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data
cleaning and preprocessing.

• Visualization: Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful
visualizations, including bar charts and count plots, to illustrate trends and
patterns.

• Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values by imputing or categorizing them
appropriately to ensure data integrity.
