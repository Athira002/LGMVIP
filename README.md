# Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Terrorism Dataset

## Objective:

To analyze global terrorism incidents from 1970 to 2017, uncovering patterns related to attack types, affected regions, target categories, and terrorist groups.

## ðŸ”§ Key Insights:

â€¢ Most Affected Country: Iraq experienced the highest number of terrorist
attacks, followed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India.

â€¢ Peak Year: 2014 recorded the most attacks, indicating a significant surge in
global terrorism activities during that period.

â€¢ Common Attack Types: Bombings and explosions were the predominant
methods used in terrorist activities.

â€¢ Primary Targets: Private citizens and property were the most frequently
targeted, with military and police forces also heavily affected.

â€¢ Active Terrorist Groups: The Taliban and ISIL were among the most active
groups, responsible for a substantial number of attacks.

## ðŸ§° Technical Approach:

â€¢ Data Handling: Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data
cleaning and preprocessing.

â€¢ Visualization: Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful
visualizations, including bar charts and count plots, to illustrate trends and
patterns.

â€¢ Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values by imputing or categorizing them
appropriately to ensure data integrity.

## Outcome:

This project provided a comprehensive overview of global terrorism trends, highlighting
critical areas and periods of concern. It showcased the ability to derive meaningful
insights from complex datasets, a crucial skill in data analytics roles.


# Project 2: Image to Pencil Sketch using OpenCV

## Objective:

This project demonstrates a simple computer vision technique to convert a colored image into a realistic pencil sketch using Python and OpenCV. It applies a series of image processing operations such as grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, and image division to recreate the effect of a hand-drawn sketch.

## ðŸ”§ Key Techniques:

Grayscale Transformation â€“ Converts the input image to black-and-white for processing.

Inversion â€“ Inverts the grayscale image to highlight edges.

Blurring â€“ Applies a Gaussian blur to simulate the softness of pencil shading.

Image Division â€“ Combines the grayscale and blurred inverted image to produce the final sketch effect.

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose:

The goal was to understand and implement basic image transformation techniques and showcase how simple operations can achieve creative visual effects. This project helped build a foundation in image preprocessing and filtering techniques in OpenCV.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used:

Python

OpenCV

Jupyter Notebook

# Project 3: Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

## Objective:

This project focuses on building a supervised machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three speciesâ€”Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginicaâ€”based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

## ðŸ§  Key Steps:

Data Exploration & Visualization â€“ Used seaborn and matplotlib for exploratory data analysis and pattern recognition.

Feature Selection & Preprocessing â€“ Focused on features like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width.

Model Training â€“ Applied classification algorithms such as:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluation â€“ Measured model accuracy using confusion matrix and classification report.

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcome:

Achieved high accuracy in classifying the iris species and gained hands-on experience in the ML pipeline from data preparation to model evaluation.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used:

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas, Numpy

Matplotlib, Seaborn
